This is a tutorial on how to hack the Nintendo Switch JoyCon to grant the user escalated access for Custom Firmware (CFW) and HomeBrew. I created this hack and tutorial to help users and myself to easily use the Nvidia Integra exploit. All fabricate, or shorting the pins on the JoyCon, potentially damaging the pins.

Also, currently all exploits require the user to use the Nvidia Integra exploit every time the Nintendo Switch is shutdown or rebooted, and this can be a burden if you are using a purchased or homemade tool. By modding your controller easily and once, you now will have a hassle free method of getting into the bootloader. This will come in handy with Xecuters USB C Modchip, for a fast and easy CFW launch (Can be found at http://www.modchipsdirect.com/nintendo-switch.html).

Please keep in mind that I am not responsible for any issues caused by this modification. With that said, follow instructions and you should be okay.

# Starting Notes
  1. Take your time. Do not rush through the project. The JoyCon hardware is sensitive (Ribbon Cables can come loose if pulled hard) and the components are small.

  2. Measure twice and Mod once. Make sure the placement of you button is in a location free of the existing hardware to insure the device closes back up again.

  3. A little goes a long way. When you are gluing or securing your button, use just a small amount of adhesive to prevent freezing up the momentary button.

# Recommended Supplies
  1. Adhesive
      * Hot glue and Hot glue Gun or
      * Liquid-Plastic Welding Tool Pen (http://a.co/b2NHN5n). I have not tested this yet.

  2. 6x6 Push Button Switch (http://a.co/0qSeANA). For $10.00 it is worth getting various button heights. 

  3. Wire and Connector (I recommend a connector to easily connect and disconnect from the button).
      * Female to Female 4 Inch Solderless Ribbon Dupont Jumper Wires (This is what I used). or
      * Wire and solder
    
  4. Soldering Iron (Try and use a fine tip soldering iron for lower heat and better control).

  5. Solder

  6. Solder Flux (Optional, but it helps solder flow).
